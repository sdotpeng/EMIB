1. Take corpus files from GazeBase and run it through EZReader Model (80% corpus)
2. EZReader generates eye movement prediction (8 metrics)
3. Use Naser's code to convert real eye movement from GazeBase into the same 8 metrics
4. Compare model prediction to real eye movement data (for 1 person) based on frequency classes (5 classes)
5. Calculate MSSE between prediction and real data
6. Update EZReader model parameters to minimize MSSE
7. When MSSE is at a minimum, we reach the smallest, record parameters
